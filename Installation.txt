To deploy jelly-cake, you will need:

- Python
This came pre-installed on Kali so???
Also not sure if compatible with 3.0 or what have you

- Virtual environment (venv)
use easy_install, pip install, or apt-get install for package virtualenv
then run [$ virtualenv venv] to create the environment
switch between virtual environments using [$ . venv/bin/activate]
